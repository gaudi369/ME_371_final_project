# Setup instructions
1. Download the data: Locate the dataset in the raw data folder and download it to your local machine.
3. Download the notebooks: Download the Maternal_Health_EDA and Maternal_Health_Modeling notebooks from the notebooks folder.
3. Organize your files: Ensure that the downloaded notebooks (Maternal_Health_EDA and Maternal_Health_Modeling) and the dataset are placed in the same directory on your local machine.
4. Run the EDA notebook: Open the Maternal_Health_EDA notebook and execute all the cells. Follow the preprocessing instructions provided at the bottom of the notebook. This step prepares the data for modeling.
5. Run the Modeling notebook: Once preprocessing is complete, open the Maternal_Health_Modeling notebook and execute it to train and evaluate the models.
